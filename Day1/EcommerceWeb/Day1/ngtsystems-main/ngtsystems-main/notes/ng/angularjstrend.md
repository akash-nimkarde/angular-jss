While **AngularJS** (the 1.x version) was once a widely used framework for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs), it is no longer actively maintained as of **January 2022**. This means that Google has officially stopped providing updates, bug fixes, and new features for AngularJS, and developers are strongly encouraged to migrate to **Angular (2+)**, which is the modern, actively supported version of the framework.

### So, Are Applications Still Using AngularJS Today?

While **AngularJS** is officially deprecated, some legacy applications built with AngularJS continue to exist and are in use. Many organizations still maintain AngularJS-based applications, especially in cases where migrating to **Angular (2+)** or other modern frameworks (like React or Vue.js) would require significant time and resources.

However, the number of new applications being developed with AngularJS has dropped significantly, as more modern frameworks and libraries are now available and widely used. Here’s a breakdown of the situation:

### 1. **Legacy Applications**
   - **Older Enterprises and Large Applications**: Some older enterprise-level applications built with AngularJS continue to run. These applications may be too large or complex to migrate easily, and the companies may have extended the support lifecycle with their own internal teams.
   - **Maintenance Phase**: Some companies that still rely on AngularJS might be in a **maintenance phase**, where they continue to operate and support their applications, but they are not actively adding new features or building new applications in AngularJS.

   Example use cases could include:
   - **Internal enterprise tools** or business applications that were built years ago and still serve their purpose.
   - **Content management systems (CMS)** or administrative dashboards that have not yet undergone a migration.

### 2. **Reasons for Continued Use of AngularJS in Some Applications**
   - **Cost of Migration**: Migrating a large AngularJS codebase to Angular (2+) or another modern framework requires substantial development time, effort, and resources. For businesses with limited budgets or complex projects, migrating might not be an immediate priority.
   - **Lack of Urgency**: Some applications built with AngularJS may still meet their business goals and be relatively free of critical issues, leading companies to continue using them as long as they work.
   - **Customizations**: Many organizations have customized AngularJS applications extensively, which could make it harder to migrate to another framework without breaking functionality.

### 3. **Migration to Modern Frameworks**
   - **Angular (2+)**: Many organizations that initially used AngularJS have **migrated** to **Angular (2+)**, which is a completely re-engineered and modern version of Angular. This provides access to modern features, better performance, and full support.
   - **React and Vue.js**: Some applications initially built with AngularJS have migrated to other popular frameworks like **React** or **Vue.js**, which have a different architectural model and are considered to have a simpler learning curve, better flexibility, and more community-driven features.

   **Example**: Large companies like **Upwork**, **Gmail**, and **Netflix** that initially used AngularJS have either migrated or are in the process of migrating to newer frameworks like **Angular (2+)** or **React** for better performance and maintainability.

### 4. **Challenges of Continuing with AngularJS**
   - **Security Risks**: Since AngularJS is no longer maintained, it doesn't receive updates for security vulnerabilities. This makes it risky to continue using AngularJS in new development.
   - **Incompatibility**: As web standards evolve, AngularJS might struggle to keep up with new browser APIs and features, leading to potential compatibility issues.
   - **Lack of Modern Features**: AngularJS does not have access to modern tooling and features that are part of Angular (2+), such as the new **Ivy rendering engine**, **TypeScript support**, or the **CLI** (Command Line Interface).
   - **Performance Issues**: AngularJS has a relatively heavier framework compared to modern frameworks, which can cause performance issues, especially in large-scale applications.

### In Summary:

While **AngularJS** is still in use for some legacy applications, **new** applications are rarely built with AngularJS today due to its deprecation and the availability of better alternatives. Instead, modern frameworks like **Angular (2+)**, **React**, and **Vue.js** have taken over because of their improved performance, maintainability, and ongoing support.

If you're working on a new project or starting from scratch, it’s highly recommended to use **Angular (2+)** or explore other modern frameworks like **React** or **Vue.js**, as AngularJS is no longer actively supported or maintained.
